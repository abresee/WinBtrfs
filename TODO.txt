TODO list

Roadmap:
Get directory listings and file info working (fs tree queries)
Get file data working (extents)
- Remove Dokan callbacks that should never be called
Esoteric Btrfs stuff
- Compression (zlib)
- Subvolumes
- Multi-drive volumes
- Converted ext4 fs
GUI (C#: which .NET version?)
Installer (NSIS)
MinGW/Cygwin[/Mono] build support
UI translations
Old OS testing

Code stuff:
Rectify inconsistent struct member names: num/nr, csum/cSum/crc32c/etc, generation/gen, objectID/objID, len/length
Rectify inconsistent function arg names: len/length, addr/lAddr/logicalAddr/physAddr/etc, super/SB/superblock
Cache frequently used blocks in memory, especially FS tree nodes and other trees that are references multiple times (extent tree?)
Multithread support for everything: make block reading threadsafe, and ensure that calls to btrfs_filesystem.c functions
	from different threads will not cause serious race conditions and/or destruction
Check all malloc/realloc calls and end fatally upon malloc failure
Develop a better system for error reporting than just piling on a bunch of assertions (look up assert best practices)
Rectify comiler warnings
Make sure performance isn't horrendous for filesystems with big FS trees (i.e. large directory structures)
	Do, say, a Linux installation on a Btrfs partition and then feed the image into WinBtrfs and have it do a dirlist or something
	Fix this with... caching? or something?
